## Full-stack web developer

# Javascript centric full stack web engineer that dabbles in indie video game development.

Currently, I work on real time chat communication tools to better connect
candidates to recruiters over at <a href="https://flashrecruit.com" target="_blank">FlashRecruit.com</a> as their lead developer.

I also code games for my game studio: <a href="http://www.deadlygoat.com" target="_blank">Deadly Goat Games</a>.
