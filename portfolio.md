#### Language

C

#### Frameworks

SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer

#### Work done

All programming and sound effects were done by myself.  Game design was co-developed by my wife and I.

This project was a great exercise in procedural C programming as I never made a game in that way before.  Inspired by the PICO-8 fantasy console prototype we started, I set out with the goal of finishing a "high definition" version of a PICO-8 game with a mobile first design limited to a single sprite sheet.

#### Language

C++

#### Framework

cocos-2dx

#### Work done

All programming was done by myself.  Game design was co-developed by my wife and I.

This project was my re-introduction to C++.  It has been years since I've done
any real C++ before starting this project.  And I wanted to take advantage of
learning some of the new C++11 features.

Runevale was also a project of learning in more ways than C++.  The project was
the very first for our company and the very first to be released on Android and
iOS market places.
