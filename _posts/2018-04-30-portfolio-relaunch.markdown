Thanks for visiting my new and improved portfolio and blog page!

I hope to share my thoughts and code snippets on various topics in all realms of
programming with you.  So, be sure to follow along and hopefully, we'll both
learn something!

This website was created using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, which makes managing a static content website or blog a breeze.  This is even easier of you know markdown, but, HTML is also supported just fine.  You can find the source code for this website <a href="https://github.com/timmendenhall/timmendenhall.com" target="_blank">here</a>.
